# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview
The Spare Parts Marketplace is a cross-platform application designed to connect spare part dealers with customers. The system enables dealers to list their products and allows customers to search, compare prices, and purchase spare parts.

## Technical Stack Decisions

### Frontend Architecture

#### Web Application: Next.js
Selected for the following reasons:
- Server-side rendering capabilities for improved SEO
- Built-in API routes simplifying backend integration
- React-based framework allowing component reuse with mobile app
- Strong TypeScript support
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Excellent performance characteristics

#### Mobile Application: React Native
Chosen because:
- Code sharing capabilities with web frontend
- Native performance on both iOS and Android
- Single codebase for multiple platforms
- Strong integration with JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- Extensive third-party library support
- Hot reloading for faster development

### Backend Architecture

#### Server: Node.js with Express
Selected for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript consistency across stack
- Large ecosystem of npm packages
- Excellent performance for API-driven applications
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Strong async I/O capabilities
- Simplified team onboarding due to unified language

#### Database: PostgreSQL
Chosen for:
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Complex query capabilities
- Full-text search features
- JSON support for flexible data structures
- Strong performance characteristics
- Robust community and tooling
- Free and open-source

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- OAuth2.0 support for social login

### File Storage
- Cloud storage (AWS S3 or equivalent) for:
  - Product images
  - User avatars
  - Document storage
- CDN integration for improved global access

### Search Implementation
- Elasticsearch for:
  - Advanced product search
  - Faceted navigation
  - Fast full-text search capabilities
  - Complex filtering and aggregations

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket implementation using Socket.io for:
  - Chat functionality
  - Real-time notifications
  - Live price updates
